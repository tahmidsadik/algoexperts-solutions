# Binary Search

Write a function that takes in a sorted array of integers as well as a target
integer. The function should use the Binary Search algorithm to determine if
the target integer is contained in the array and should return its index if it
is, otherwise 

If you're unfamiliar with Binary Search, we recommend watching the Conceptual
Overview section of this question's video explanation before starting to code.

## Sample Input
```
array = [0, 1, 21, 33, 45, 45, 61, 71, 72, 73];
target = 33;
```

## Sample Output
```
3
```

## Time Complexity
O(log(n))

## Space Complexity
O(log(n)) - because of the function stacks
