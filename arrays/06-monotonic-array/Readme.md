# Monotonic Array

## Problem Statement

Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a boolean
representing whether the array is monotonic.

An array is said to be monotonic if its elements, from left to right, are
entirely non-increasing or entirely non-decreasing.

### Sample Input

```
array = [-1, -5, -10, -1100, -1100, -1101, -1102, -9001]
```

### Sample Output

```
true
```

## Time Complexity

O(n) - As the array is iterated only once.

## Space Coplexity

O(1) - no additional space is used.
